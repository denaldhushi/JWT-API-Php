# JWT to authenticate users

To authenticate a user, a client application must send a JSON Web Token (JWT) in the authorization header of the HTTP request to your backend API. API Gateway validates the token on behalf of your API, so you don't have to add any code in your API to process the authentication. However, you do need to configure the API config for your gateway to support your chosen authentication methods.

This is a simple JWT authentication project and a API setup with PHP.
